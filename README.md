About programming assignment 2. 
The entire code is available in the ipynb linked above.
In this assignment, we explore the application of two reinforcement learning algorithms, REINFORCE and Dueling Deep Q-Network (Dueling DQN), to solve control tasks in the CartPole-v1 and Acrobot-v1 environments from the Gymnasium library. These environments present challenging control problems that require learning effective policies to achieve the desired goals.
